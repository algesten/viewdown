A Markdown Viewer
=================

Application that opens `.md`
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files for
viewing. The uses file system events to figure out when the source
markdown file changes and refresh the viewer with the new markup. This
means I can use my favourite text editor (emacs) to edit my markdown
files at the same time as seeing the results.
